PROJECTS
OktetAI – oktetai.com (JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, EJS, AWS)
Apr. 2024 - Present
• Developed a platform enabling seamless interaction with multiple advanced AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini,
Llama) simultaneously while also allowing users to take notes and paraphrase their work.
• Published LLMRest, a modular AI client, as an NPM package, to manage integrations with multiple AI services,
ensuring secure API interactions through input validation and content moderation.
• Designed scalable backend systems using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, incorporating secure authentication
with Google OAuth, secure email integration with NodeMailer, and payment processing with Stripe. • Deployed
infrastructure on AWS using EC2, CloudFront, Certificate Manager, and Route53
Movie Success Prediction Analysis (Python Programming, Machine Learning)
Nov. – Dec. 2024
• Designed machine learning pipeline for movie success prediction using Random Forest & Gradient Boosting (94.86%
accuracy, F1-score: 0.89).
• Engineered custom features, including profit and success scoring based on vote average, vote count, and
popularity.
• Applied SMOTE for class balancing & conducted EDA with matplotlib/seaborn.
UK Soccer Player Valuation Analysis (Python Programming, Machine Learning)
Sept. – Dec. 2023
• Developed a machine learning pipeline to assess the market valuation of UK soccer players. This project involved
comprehensive data collection, data cleansing, and the application of machine learning techniques.
• Utilized Random Forest Regression (140 estimators), achieving an R² score of 0.746, outperforming other models
such as KNN and SVM regressors.
Reversi Game Development (Java, Unit Testing, MVC Architecture)
Oct. – Dec. 2023
• Utilized Java for algorithm design, game development, AI strategy implementation, and unit testing.
• Engineered a hexagonal-grid based Reversi game model in Java, adhering to standard two-player rules with variable
grid size capabilities. Implemented model-view-controller architecture; the model managed game state, rules, and
player interactions, and the view provided text output with scope for future graphical enhancements.
“The Future is Yours” Book Project (Author)
Feb. 2019 – Jan. 2022
• Interviewed 11 leaders, wrote and published a book, used sales revenue to donate medical devices and tablets, and
received media coverage, including Hurriyet.
